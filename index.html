    <p>-Greenland sharks are the longest-living vertebrates. For 300-500 years, they take life very slowly, moving at an average of 0.76 mph. As resilience comes from balance and stability, this collection conveys ideals of stillness and tranquility. Intricate artistry and handcrafted details engage human connections, with the hopes that simplistic elegance will endure the testament of time.
